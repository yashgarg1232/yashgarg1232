### Hi! I'm Yash 👋

A work in progress, constantly adding commits to be life coupled with frequent code reviews of my new findings. I am Ph.D. candidate (focusing on information retrieval in high-dimensional space using conventional feature extraction and deep feature learning) at Arizona State University, advised by Dr. K. Selcuk Candan. I have been fortunate to be awarded Doctoral Fellowship Award (from Graduate College, and from Department of Computer Science), and Outstanding Mentor Award. I am a frequently found on visit StackOverflow, and Reddit, if not elsewhere.

At heart, I’m a young idealist who dreams of a life of adventure, excitement, and exploration. But my brain is an old pragmatic soul, obsessed with being responsible and ensuring the security of our future self (1). I am an avid book reader with a particular interest in history, psycology, and self-improvement. Some of my best reads is Ego is the Enemy by Ryan Holiday (2).
