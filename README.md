### Hi! I'm Yash ðŸ‘‹

A work in progress, constantly adding commits to the repository called `life` coupled with frequent code reviews of my new findings. I am Ph.D. candidate (focusing on information retrieval in high-dimensional space using conventional feature extraction and deep feature learning) at Arizona State University, advised by Dr. K. Selcuk Candan. I have been fortunate to be awarded Doctoral Fellowship Award (from Graduate College, and from Department of Computer Science), and Outstanding Mentor Award. I am more frequently found on StackOverflow, and Reddit, if not elsewhere.

At heart, Iâ€™m a young idealist who dreams of a life of adventure, excitement, and exploration. But my brain is an old pragmatic soul, obsessed with being responsible and ensuring the security of our future self (1). I am an avid book reader with a particular interest in history, psychology, and self-improvement. Some of my best reads is `Ego is the Enemy` by Ryan Holiday (2).
