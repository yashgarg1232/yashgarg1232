### Hi! I'm Yash ðŸ‘‹

A work in progress, constantly adding `commits` to the repository called `life` coupled with frequent `code reviews` from my new `experiences` as the life evolves. Recently, earned the Doctorate in Computer Science from Arizona State University. Researching at the intersection of feature extraction and deep feature learning for multimedia retrieval. Recipient of Graduate Doctoral Fellowship and Computer Science Doctoral Fellowship at Arizona State University. I have been awarded Outstanding Mentor Award for mentoring NSF-funded REU (Research Initiative for Undergraduates) researchers. I am frequently found on StackOverflow, and Reddit, if not elsewhere.

At heart, Iâ€™m a young idealist who dreams of a life of adventure, excitement, and exploration. But my brain is an old pragmatic soul, obsessed with being responsible and ensuring the security of our future self (1). I am an avid book reader with a particular interest in history, philosophy, Ancient Greek Literature and self-improvement. Some of my best reads is `Ego is the Enemy` by Ryan Holiday (2).
